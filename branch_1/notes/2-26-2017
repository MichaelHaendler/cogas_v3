what do I want to do today code wise? 

get mouse location, keyboard input. 

get character to move around based on keyboard input 

get character to stop moving when there is no keyboard input. 


if we do it globally then we can update the code from the classes
themselves, and not do it externally. 

I think that I have no fucking idea what the future is going to bring
in terms of the design of this code (this...despite me having been
at this point about a million times in the past). So I'm just gonna
have each object run an "refresh_and_draw()" method that will be
responsible for all of the updates, and then drawing the image onto
the screen.
